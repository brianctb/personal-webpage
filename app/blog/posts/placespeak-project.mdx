In April 2025, I had the opportunity to collaborate with **PlaceSpeak** and a team of BCIT Computer Systems Technology students as part of the Industry Sponsored Student Projects (ISSP) program.

PlaceSpeak is a privacy-protected civic network that connects individuals and organizations for meaningful, location-based engagement. Designed to combat bots and trolls, it ensures legitimate feedback to inform policy decisions.

## Our goal

Our goal was to build an AI-powered analytics system that transforms raw public consultation feedback into meaningful, actionable insights.

1. Integrating Nltk for Advanced NLP Analysis

   - Leverage the OpenAI API to perform summary of public feedback and graphs.

2. Designing the Data Processing Pipeline

   - Build a full-stack analytics pipeline using Python, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite to handle cached generated reports to limit cost.

3. Enabling Dynamic Report Generation

   - Sentiment distribution charts (pie & bar graphs)

   - Keyword clouds to highlight frequent topics

   - Top phrases analysis using N-grams for contextual insights

   - Implement PDF report generation using jsPDF, allowing users to download insights for further analysis.

## The Product

By the end of the project, we delivered a fully functional analytics dashboard that fulfilled all of the goals above and allowed PlaceSpeak to:

- Analyze large volumes of public feedback from their network using AI
- Visualize trends through interactive charts and word clouds
- Generate downloadable reports for users and clients

## Conclusion

Working on the PlaceSpeak-BCIT ISSP project was an incredible learning experience. It reinforced the importance of AI-driven analytics in public engagement and allowed me to contribute to a solution that helps organizations make data-driven decisions.

Iâ€™m excited to continue exploring AI, NLP, and data visualization in future projects!
